For a *plant density optimization* project, your EDA should center on understanding how *planting density*, *environmental conditions*, and *management practices* affect **yield (biomass_seed) and NUE**. Here are the best EDA questions for your goal:

---

### 🌿 Core Objective: *Density vs. Yield*

1. **How does plant_density correlate with biomass_seed?**
2. **What is the optimal density_relative or density_factor range for high yield?**
3. **Do density_error and crowding impact yield or NUE negatively?**
4. **How does density_n_ratio relate to biomass_seed and NUE?**

---

### ⚙️ Management & Fertilization

5. **How do different management, cultivar, and n_fertilisation_type strategies affect yield at varying densities?**
6. **Is there an interaction between n_amount and plant_density on yield/NUE?**
7. **Do cultivar_mix or mixture_design outperform monocultures at higher densities?**

---

### ☀️ Environmental Influences

8. **Does soil_water_capacity moderate the effect of density on yield?**
9. **Are yield responses to density different under high GDD, heat_stress_days, or total_precipitation?**
10. *Is there a density threshold beyond which stress factors (e.g., heat, humidity) reduce yield sharply?*

---

### 📍 Location and Crop Factors

11. *Are there regional or `site`-based differences in optimal planting density?*
12. **Do specific species, plant_family, or previous_crop types benefit more from denser planting?**

---

### 📊 Yield Targeting

13. *What are the density conditions in the top 10% highest-yielding plots?*
14. *Can we cluster observations into low, medium, and high-yield zones based on density-related features?*

These questions will guide both your exploratory analysis and the direction of your modeling for optimization. Let me know if you'd like them broken down into visualization types.
